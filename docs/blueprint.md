- Background color: Very light desaturated blue (#F0F8FF) for a clean, calming backdrop that doesn’t distract from the content.
- Accent color: Slightly darker blue (#87CEEB) to complement the primary color while adding visual interest and highlighting key interactive elements, like links and button hovers.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for headers and body to combine a modern look with warmth.
- Use clear, recognizable icons relevant to the services provided, in a style matching the overall blue color scheme.
- Ensure a clean and responsive design with clear content sections and easy navigation.
